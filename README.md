# README: Deep Q-Learning - Lunar Lander

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`C3_W3_A1_Assignment.ipynb`) is part of the **Reinforcement Learning Specialization** offered by **Coursera**, specifically the final course in the specialization taught by **Andrew Ng**. This notebook represents my first deep learning application, where I implemented a **Deep Q-Learning** algorithm to train an agent to safely land a lunar lander on a landing pad on the surface of the moon.

The notebook is structured to guide you through the process of building and training a Deep Q-Network (DQN) using the **OpenAI Gym** environment, specifically the **LunarLander-v2** environment. The goal is to train an agent to navigate the lunar lander to a safe landing using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Reinforcement Learning Basics**: Understanding the agent-environment interaction loop, where the agent takes actions based on the environment's state and receives rewards.
2. **Deep Q-Learning**: Implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to approximate the action-value function, which helps the agent decide the best action to take in a given state.
3. **Experience Replay**: Using a memory buffer to store and sample experiences, which helps in stabilizing the training process by breaking the correlation between consecutive experiences.
4. **Target Network**: Implementing a separate target network to generate stable Q-value targets, which reduces oscillations and instabilities during training.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Setting and adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and memory buffer size to optimize the agent's performance.
6. **Training the Agent**: Running the training loop to allow the agent to interact with the environment, learn from experiences, and improve its policy over time.
7. **Evaluation**: Observing the trained agent in action and evaluating its performance in the Lunar Lander environment.

## Notebook Structure
The notebook is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm:

1. **Import Packages**: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.
2. **Hyperparameters**: Defining key hyperparameters for the DQN.
3. **The Lunar Lander Environment**: Understanding the environment's action space, observation space, rewards, and episode termination conditions.
4. **Loading the Environment**: Initializing the Lunar Lander environment and exploring its dynamics.
5. **Deep Q-Learning**: Implementing the DQN and target network, and setting up the optimizer.
6. **Experience Replay**: Creating a memory buffer to store and sample experiences.
7. **Training the Agent**: Running the training loop to train the agent using the DQN algorithm.
8. **Evaluation**: Observing the trained agent's performance in the Lunar Lander environment.

## My Experience
This notebook marks my first deep learning application, and it was an exciting journey to apply the concepts I learned in the Reinforcement Learning Specialization. The course, taught by Andrew Ng, provided a solid foundation in reinforcement learning, and this assignment allowed me to put that knowledge into practice by building a DQN from scratch.

The most challenging part was understanding and implementing the **Experience Replay** and **Target Network** mechanisms, which are crucial for stabilizing the training process. However, with the guidance provided in the course and the structured approach of the notebook, I was able to successfully train the agent to land the lunar lander safely.

## How to Use This Notebook
1. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including `gym`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, and `PIL`.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Follow the notebook step-by-step, starting from importing packages to training the agent and evaluating its performance.
3. **Experiment with Hyperparameters**: Try adjusting the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) to see how they affect the agent's learning process.
4. **Observe the Agent**: After training, observe the agent's performance in the Lunar Lander environment and see how well it can land the lunar lander.

## Conclusion
This notebook is a great starting point for anyone interested in reinforcement learning and deep learning. It provides a hands-on experience in implementing a DQN and training an agent to solve a real-world problem. I hope this notebook serves as a useful resource for others who are beginning their journey in reinforcement learning.
